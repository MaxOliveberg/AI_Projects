# Reinforcement Learning (Work in progress)
A collection of environments and applications of different Reinforcement learning algorithms to these environments. Some environments are part of the OpenAI Gym package, while some are self made.

## Project structure
Each environment is self contained, with their own requirements file and their own README file. However, they are all implemented in Python. 

Within each environment folder, there are a number of modules containing different applications. To run a module, run `python3 -m MODULE_NAME`.
